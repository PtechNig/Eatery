This collection is about project given to me as an assignment by my facilitator Mr. Aaron Attah Ojima in the course of my software backend engineering training at PORA Academy between January to June, 2024.

Project Assignment: Eatery Server-Side Application

Objective:

Build a server-side application for an eatery, focusing on authentication and two additional endpoints. Utilize MongoDB for database management, Postman for API testing and documentation, and GitHub for version control.

Requirements:

Authentication Endpoint:

Implement user registration and login functionality using a chosen authentication framework (e.g., Passport.js), or email and password.

Ensure proper password hashing and verification.

Eatery Endpoints:

Menu Endpoint: Create an endpoint to retrieve the eatery's menu, including dish names, descriptions, and prices.

Order Endpoint: Develop an endpoint to process orders, accepting dish IDs and quantities, and returning a confirmation message.

API Testing and Documentation:

Use Postman to test and document your API endpoints, including request and response examples.
Database Management:

Design a MongoDB schema to store users, menu items, and orders.

Implement CRUD operations for each collection as needed.

Deployment:

Deploy your application to a chosen platform (e.g., Render, GCP, swiftwave etc)

Provide a live URL for testing and evaluation.

GitHub Repository:

Create a GitHub repository for your project, including all source code and documentation.

Ensure proper commit history and version control.(not less than 5 commits)
